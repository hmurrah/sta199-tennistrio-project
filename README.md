# What Makes a Good Wine?

This project aims to analyze wine rankings in order to explore how to pick the best wines. User zackthoutt on Kaggle collected this data by scraping data from WineEnthusiast.com.

The variables relevant to our project are as follows.

- `X1`: Number corresponding to the observation. Listed in ascending order from 0
- `country`: The country that the wine is from
- `description`: A few sentences from a sommelier describing the wine's taste, smell, look, feel, etc.
- `points`: The number of points WineEnthusiast rated the wine on a scale of 1-100 (though they say they only post reviews for wines that score greater than or equal to 80)
- `price`: The cost for a bottle of the wine
- `variety`: The type of grapes used to make the wine (ie Pinot Noir)
